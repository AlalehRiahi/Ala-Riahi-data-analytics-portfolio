# Data Analytics Portfolio – Ala Riahi

This portfolio showcases a selection of data analytics case studies demonstrating my ability to translate business problems into analytical frameworks and deliver actionable insights using modern data tools.

It is structured to reflect multidimensional capability across:
- **Customer & product analytics (Tableau + SQL)**
- **Statistical analysis & data exploration (Python)**
- **Business decision support & scenario modeling (Excel)**

I designed these projects to simulate real-world scenarios in SaaS, behavioral data analysis, and impact optimization. Each case follows an end-to-end flow: defining business questions → structuring data → analysis → visualization → recommendations.

##  Portfolio Projects

### 1️- Improving 30-Day Retention in an Adaptive Learning SaaS  
**Tools:** Tableau, SQL (PostgreSQL – simulated), Python (exploration), GenAI concept  
**Focus:** Customer journey analytics, cohort analysis, behavioral segmentation, actionable insights

A conceptual project where I model user lifecycle and retention behavior in an adaptive learning platform. I design a realistic data schema, perform segment-based analysis, build Tableau retention dashboards, and develop product recommendations. Includes a conceptual demonstration of a GenAI query assistant for rapid stakeholder insights.

### 2️- Statistical Comparison of User Segments using Python  
**Tools:** Python (pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook  
**Focus:** Statistical hypothesis testing, user behavior analysis, A/B style comparison

This project uses simulated or anonymized data to analyze whether changes in onboarding or product structure lead to statistically significant improvements in engagement and retention. Includes EDA, segment analysis, hypothesis testing (t-test / chi-square), and business interpretation of results.

### 3️- Business Performance & Scenario Analysis Model (Excel)  
**Tools:** Excel, PivotTables, formulas, dashboards  
**Focus:** KPI modeling, forecasting, decision support

An Excel-driven case where I build a structured performance tracking model (e.g., content performance, program return, or retention impact). Includes KPI tracking, visual dashboarding, and scenario analysis to support business planning.

##  Analytical Approach & Strengths

Across projects, I emphasize:
- Translating complex business questions into structured metrics
- Working across relational data using SQL and analytical logic
- Designing visual dashboards that tell clear insight stories
- Applying statistical reasoning to evaluate significance and impact
- Communicating recommendations tailored to business and product stakeholders
- Exploring how GenAI can augment insight delivery and speed to action

I bring multidisciplinary experience from data, education design, and behavioral analytics to approach customer patterns as narratives—not just metrics.
