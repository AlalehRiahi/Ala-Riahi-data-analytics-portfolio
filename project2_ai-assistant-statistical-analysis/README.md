## Project Summary

This project analyzes user behavior and model performance in an AI assistant dataset 
using Python-based statistical methods. The results show high stability across devices, 
models, and interaction patterns.

### Key Findings
- **Satisfaction is consistent:** No significant differences across device type or 
  assistant model (ANOVA p-values > 0.05).
- **Model efficiency is similar:** No significant difference in token usage across GPT-4o, 
  GPT-5, and GPT-5.1.
- **No significant correlations:** Prompt length, session duration, tokens used, and 
  satisfaction ratings show no meaningful linear relationships (Pearson p-values > 0.05).

### Interpretation
The AI assistant provides a uniform user experience across platforms and workloads. 
Statistical tests confirm that interaction patterns are stable and largely independent 
of model or device.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Python data analysis (Pandas, Seaborn)
- Statistical hypothesis testing (ANOVA, Pearson)
- Data visualization and interpretation
- Reproducible notebook workflow
